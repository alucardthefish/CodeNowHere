# Contributing Guidelines

* Remember that this is an inclusive community, committed to creating a safe, positive environment.  See the full [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alucardthefish/CodeNowHere/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Please consider raising an issue before submitting a pull request (PR) to solve a problem that is not present in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/alucardthefish/CodeNowHere/issues). This allows maintainers to first validate the issue you are trying to solve and also reference the PR to a specific issue.
* When developing a new feature, include at least one test when applicable.
* When submitting a PR, please follow [this template](https://github.com/alucardthefish/CodeNowHere/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) (which will probably be already filled up once you create the PR).
* When creating an issue to report a bug in the project, please follow our [bug_report.md](https://github.com/alucardthefish/CodeNowHere/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) template.
* When creating an issue to request new feature in the project, please follow our [bug_report.md](https://github.com/alucardthefish/CodeNowHere/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) template.


## General Guidelines

* In an active repository (not an archived one), choose an open issue from the issue list, claim it in the comments, and a maintainer will assign it to you.  
* Create a branch specific to the issue you're working on, so that you send a PR from that branch instead of the base branch on your fork.
* If youâ€™d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. 
* Have a short description on what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.
